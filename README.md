# ToDoList

My first pet project.

It started as a homework  in the Python Developer course from robot_dreams.

But during the implementation, I turned it into a study of Tkinter.

Currently implemented:

• Adding and removing tasks

• Adding and removing subtasks

• Ability to set and change the deadline for a task• Ability to mark a task/subtask as completed

• When marking all subtasks of a task as completed, the main task is also marked as completed

• Automatic saving of the list to a JSON file

• Ability to create and change a file for task storage

• Context menu on right-click (tested and working on macOS and Windows)

• Logging, can be enabled in the settings

To start: clone of download main.py and filework.py and run main.py
Default settings file will be created automatically
