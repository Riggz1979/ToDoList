# ToDoList

My first pet project.
It started as a homework  in the Python Developer course from robot_dreams.
But during the implementation, I turned it into a study of Tkinter.
Currently implemented:
• Adding and removing tasks
• Adding and removing subtasks
• Ability to set and change the deadline for a task
• Ability to mark a task/subtask as completed
• When marking all subtasks of a task as completed, the main task is also marked as completed
• Automatic saving of the list to a JSON file
• Ability to create and modify a file for task storage
• Context menu on right-click (tested and working on macOS and Windows)
• Logging, can be enabled in the settings
